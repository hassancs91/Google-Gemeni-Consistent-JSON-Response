## Introduction

Working with language models like Google Gemini often results in inconsistent and unstructured JSON outputs. This project aims to solve this by implementing a 9 Step approuch to ensure a consistent JSON structure, this is beneficial for application development.

For more detailed information, please refer to my [blog post](https://learnwithhasan.com/consistent-json-gemini-python/) on the project.


## Features

- **Pydantic Model Integration**: Utilize Pydantic models to define and validate JSON structure.
- **Optimized Prompt Engineering**: Enhance language model prompts for more consistent responses.
- **JSON Extraction and Validation**: Reliable methods to extract and validate JSON from model responses.

## Example Application

Included is a 'Simple Blog Title Generator Tool' demonstrating the practical application of the project.
